/**
 * This event is called when a command is run from the server console. It is
 * called early in the command handling process, and modifications in this
 * event (via {@link #setCommand(String)}) will be shown in the behavior.
 * <p>
 * Many plugins will have <b>no use for this event</b>, and you should
 * attempt to avoid using it if it is not necessary.
 * <p>
 * Some examples of valid uses for this event are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Logging executed commands to a separate file
 * <li>Variable substitution. For example, replacing <code>${ip:Steve}</code>
 *     with the connection IP of the player named Steve, or simulating the
 *     <code>@a</code> and <code>@p</code> decorators used by Command Blocks
 *     for plugins that do not handle it.
 * <li>Conditionally blocking commands belonging to other plugins.
 * <li>Per-sender command aliases. For example, after the console runs the
 *     command <code>/calias cr gamemode creative</code>, the next time they
 *     run <code>/cr</code>, it gets replaced into
 *     <code>/gamemode creative</code>. (Global command aliases should be
 *     done by registering the alias.)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Examples of incorrect uses are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Using this event to run command logic
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If the event is cancelled, processing of the command will halt.
 * <p>
 * The state of whether or not there is a slash (<code>/</code>) at the
 * beginning of the message should be preserved. If a slash is added or
 * removed, unexpected behavior may result.
